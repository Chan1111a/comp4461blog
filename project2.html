				<h2 class="">Description of the Project and My Goal</h2>
				<p>
					Our project aims to enhance the theme park experience by focusing on the hospitality sector within
					the tourism industry. We are developing a chatbot named Tom, designed to provide real-time guidance
					to visitors. Tom will utilize multimodal communication to overcome language barriers and offer
					assistance free of charge. This initiative is structured around three key phases: empathy, ideation,
					and prototyping, with the goal of improving guest satisfaction and accessibility in theme parks.
				</p>

				<h2 class="mt-5">My Learning and Execution Process</h2>
				<p>
					At the start of the project, we were sitting in the library, struggling to figure out how an LLM
					agent could enhance hospitality. A chatbot seemed too virtual and not practical enough for real-life
					services, which are the core of hospitality. We couldn't come up with a solid solution, so we
					decided to empathize with potential users.
				</p>
				<p>
					We interviewed several students on campus and discovered that many of them enjoy traveling. One
					interviewee mentioned that he often feels shy and afraid of being charged when asking for guidance
					while traveling. He suggested that a live agent providing real-time guidance would be great, as it
					would help him overcome shyness and language barriers without any cost.
				</p>
				<p>
					With this insight, we conducted online research and found that theme parks are a popular tourist
					destination. We decided it would be practical to build a specific agent for theme parks to provide
					guidance to visitors. We then moved to the ideation process to design detailed functions. Sunny
					created storyboards for three versions: a voice agent, staff assistance, and an online map agent.
				</p>
				<p>
					We conducted "speed dating" by showing our storyboards to people of different age ranges and found
					issues with all three versions. Most interviewees suggested that combining the three versions would
					make the agent more functional and complete. We took their suggestions into account and modified
					each function, concluding that our agent should have three main functions: crowd level
					consideration, emergency assistance, and guiding way.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, we moved to the prototyping phase, assigning different tasks. I was assigned the relatively
					easy task of creating a map of the theme park, which I will discuss in more detail in the next
					section.

				<h2 class="mt-5">My Personal Contributions and Achievements</h2>
				<p>
					I was responsible for designing the theme park map. I started by researching the essential
					facilities in theme parks, as I couldn't immediately come up with a detailed map. I then recalled my
					experience traveling to Ueno Zoo Park in Tokyo, Japan, and found that reading their map helped me
					brainstorm ideas for our own theme park map.
				</p>
				<p>
					With a brief idea of how a theme park should look, I drew a simple map using the app Procreate. The
					map is divided into two main areas: one for performances, including parade areas, outdoor stages,
					and theaters, and another for playgrounds, featuring popular amusement rides such as water rides,
					roller coasters, and skyscrapers. Additionally, the map includes restaurants and toilets.
				</p>
				<p>
					After creating the map, I integrated it into a Python class, which allows the agent to easily
					retrieve facility names, descriptions, and their paths. I also set up coordinates for each facility
					to help the system calculate the shortest path, providing better guidance and reducing travel time
					for users. However, I encountered some problems with this design, which I will discuss further in
					the next section.

				<h2 class="mt-5">My Personal Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					In this project, I learned the importance of empathizing with users and basing solutions on their
					suggestions and needs. For example, I initially overlooked the language barrier in theme parks,
					assuming that staff usually speak English. However, during interviews, people mentioned that this is
					not always the case, especially in non-English speaking countries. This taught me that we often
					overlook potential problems due to incorrect assumptions. I will always remember to think carefully
					and verify my assumptions by consulting different types of users.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, I realized that the design of my map was not very user-friendly. During user testing,
					a friend pointed out that having only one entrance/exit in the park was inconvenient. If a user is
					at the outdoor stage, which is the farthest from the entrance, they would have to walk a long
					distance to leave the park. This feedback taught me to always consider more suggestions from user
					tests and think more critically about design choices.
				</p>
				<p>
					Participating in this project has not only helped me understand the needs and challenges in the
					hospitality industry but also taught me how to provide innovative solutions using design thinking. I
					believe this framework is very helpful and well-structured, enabling me to identify problems and
					develop practical solutions. This experience will be invaluable in my future growth as a computer
					engineer.

				<h2 class="">Description of the Project and My Goal</h2>
				<p>This is the first project in the course, the theme is that we will have
					visiting students from the
					animal kingdom and explore how our campus can become more welcoming to them. This project consists
					of need-finding, ideation and group presentation. In the process of this imaginative project, I have
					experienced the core idea of design thinking by empathizing with the users.</p>
				<p>My goal is to develop a design thinking mindset and solve practical problems from the user's point of
					view. I believe that this mindset can help me design more user-friendly products and develop
					important skills for my career, especially when I am aiming to be a web developer and designer.</p>

				<h2 class="mt-5">My Learning and Execution Process</h2>
				<p>We began by identifying potential issues, such as small animals struggling with stairs, and conducted
					site visits to verify our thoughts. We interviewed seven people, gathering insights like dogs having
					difficulty seeing road signs due to their height and color blindness. In this process, we found out
					that we may have overlooked some obvious existing problems and understand that thinking from the
					users' perspective helps us to discover those problems. After visiting and interviewing, we started
					recording and summarizing these interviews. By having these insights as a start, we brainstormed
					solutions, including a scent-based navigation system for dogs and adjustable stairs for rabbits. Our
					most practical idea was a food recommendation system tailored to different animals' dietary needs.
					Once we have finished brainstorming, we almost forgot to relate our ideas back to an extreme version
					of the existing problems but not only problems for the animals. For the case of the food
					recommendation system, we related the problem to people having different dietary needs such as
					vegans and on diet. At the end, we documented our ideas in a mind map and presented our findings in
					class, highlighting how we used a design thinking approach to solve the problem of animal visiting
					students.</p>

				<h2 class="mt-5">My Personal Contributions and Achievements</h2>
				<p>During the needfinding phase, I actively participated in interviewing and recording the results. I
					interviewed a student from the Civil Engineering department who provided the insight that cats might
					struggle to catch fish for their meals. Inspired by this, I brought the idea into the next phase. In
					the Ideation phase, I reported the food-finding problem to my groupmates and suggested that animals
					might have difficulty fulfilling their special dietary needs. I proposed a food recommendation
					system for the canteen ordering machines, which would help animals select personalized food options
					based on their preferences. The workflow involves animal students logging in and indicating their
					dietary preferences in the UST student center, which would then be updated to the system server.
					When users tap their student card on the ordering machine in the canteen, the menu would be
					personalized according to their preferences. I came up with this idea through a humorous joke,
					suggesting that if chicken students came to UST and saw chicken meat on the menu, it would be like a
					horror movie! Our system would filter out chicken meat from the menu and suggest corn-related meals
					instead if the chicken students are ordering. My groupmates agreed that this was a good solution, so
					I documented it on the mind map. During our presentation, we shared this idea, and the audience
					found the joke amusing!</p>

				<h2 class="mt-5">My Personal Reflection</h2>
				<p>Through this project, I have gained valuable knowledge about the importance of collaboration and
					using a design thinking approach to solve existing problems as a team. Specifically, I learned that
					the emphasis on empathy in this approach helps me think from the user's perspective and address real
					problems related to their needs. For example, by interviewing people on the campus, I discovered
					some interesting insights such as cats might struggle to catch fish in HKUST and chickens cannot eat
					chicken meat in canteen! By the end of this project, I have gained experience in using design
					thinking to solve problems, which I believe will be highly beneficial in my career as a web
					developer and designer. </p>
				<p>One key lesson I learned is to always think from the user's point of view, as failing to do so can
					lead to overlooking important insights and attempting to solve non-existent problems. For example,
					at first, we thought that we could design special footwear for birds to climb stairs if they are too
					small. However, when we think from their perspective, we find that birds can fly and do not need to
					climb stairs so this is an non-existing problem. Without a clear understanding of the problem, it is
					impossible to introduce an effective solution. Therefore, I have learned that whenever I am trying
					to solve a problem, I will strive to clarify the problem by emphasizing the user's perspective.</p>

				<h2 class="mt-5">AI Usage</h2>
				<p>
					We have used AI in our project to give us some starting ideas. You can refer to the conversation below:

				<h2 class="">Description of the Project and My Goal</h2>
				<p>
					Our group project focuses on enhancing the experience of trading second-hand furniture through the
					integration of Extended Reality (XR) technologies, specifically Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual
					Reality (VR). The platform we are developing allows buyers to preview furniture in an immersive and
					interactive way using AR, enabling them to visualize how items would look and fit within their own
					living spaces. This helps address common concerns such as size, style compatibility, and condition
					of the furniture. On the seller's side, the platform provides tools to scan and upload 3D models of
					their furniture into a virtual marketplace built with Unity. This virtual environment serves as a
					dynamic and engaging medium for showcasing items and facilitating transactions. My personal goal in
					this project is to explore the various interaction methods and design approaches within XR, and to
					understand how these technologies can address limitations found in traditional, physical trading
					environments. I am particularly interested in how XR can bridge the gap between digital and physical
					spaces to create more intuitive and effective user experiences.
				</p>

				<h2 class="">My Learning and Execution Process</h2>
				<p>Our team spent the first day brainstorming ideas but initially struggled to reach a consensus due to
					the broad scope of the project topic. Eventually, one of my teammates, Luffy, proposed focusing on
					second-hand furniture trading, highlighting several issues he had observed in existing systems.
					Since we couldn't settle on a better idea at the time, we agreed to explore this direction further.
					We began by distributing a survey to gather user insights and received 17 responses. Interestingly,
					around 90% of respondents had experience buying or selling second-hand furniture in Hong Kong,
					confirming the relevance of our chosen theme. From their qualitative feedback, we identified five
					major challenges: size and fit issues, quality and condition, logistics and delivery, pricing
					concerns, and trust and communication. Our project aimed to address the first three challenges
					through XR technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					To better understand user's needs, we asked participants about their expectations. The top needs
					include the ability to visualize furniture in their own space and to preview 3D models using AR
					instead of static photos. To validate these findings, we visited a physical furniture store near
					Prince Edward Station. This visit confirmed several pain points, such as the time cost of traveling
					and the inability to preview how furniture would look in a home setting. We then moved into the
					ideation phase, using mind maps and user personas to shape our solution. We also analyzed existing
					platforms through storyboarding and conducted speed dating sessions with potential users to refine
					our concept.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once we finalized our idea, we transitioned to prototyping. We built a virtual marketplace using
					Unity and published it on Spatial.io. To support sellers, we developed a mobile app that converts
					furniture photos into 3D models, which can then be uploaded to the virtual market. Buyers can
					download these models and use AR to visualize them in their own rooms, improving their understanding
					of the furniture's condition and fit. After completing our prototype, we conducted usability
					testing. The feedback was largely positive—users found the concept innovative and practical for
					solving the identified issues. However, some noted that the AR features could be improved in terms
					of accuracy, which we recognized as an area for future enhancement.

				<h2 class="mt-5">My Personal Contributions and Achievements</h2>
				<P>
					In this project, my primary responsibility was centered around the empathy phase, where I focused on
					understanding user needs and translating them into actionable insights for our solution. I designed
					and distributed a Google Form to collect responses from potential users, and then systematically
					organized and analyzed the feedback to identify key pain points and expectations. This process
					helped us define a user-centric direction for our platform.
				</P>
				<p>
					To evaluate existing solutions and identify areas for improvement, I applied the GOMS (Goals,
					Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) model. This allowed us to compare the efficiency and
					usability of current platforms and extract both their strengths and limitations. These insights
					directly informed the design of our own solution, ensuring it addressed common user frustrations
					while incorporating effective features from existing systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, I contributed to the ideation phase by constructing a detailed mind map that helped
					visualize and organize potential features for our platform. This collaborative process enabled our
					team to explore a wide range of ideas and refine them into a cohesive and innovative solution.
					Through these contributions, I gained valuable experience in user research, interaction analysis,
					and early-stage design thinking.

				<h2 class="mt-5">My Personal Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the potential of Extended Reality (XR) within
					the field of Human-Computer Interaction. I learned how XR technologies, such as AR and VR, can be
					applied to solve real-world problems that traditional physical solutions alone cannot
					address—particularly in areas like visualization, spatial understanding, and user engagement. This
					experience deepened my appreciation for the unique strengths of XR in enhancing user experiences and
					bridging the gap between digital and physical environments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, I developed a better understanding of how to design XR solutions that are both
					user-friendly and effective. From conducting user research to prototyping and testing, I learned the
					importance of grounding design decisions in real user needs and feedback. This project not only
					strengthened my technical and analytical skills but also helped me grow as a computer engineer who
					is more empathetic, thoughtful, and solution oriented.
